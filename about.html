<section class="about-section">
  <h1></h1>
  <p>This portfolio is a built-from-scratch website showcasing five years of User Experience learning and design. My journey began at NC State University, where I became heavily involved in <a href="https://acmclaug.wordpress.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank">LACElab,</a> under the mentorship of Dr. Anne McLaughlin. <br>It was there that I discovered and developed my passion for psychology and technology. During my time at LACElab, I participated in undergraduate research and UX projects, even traveling to the Johnson Space Center for a NASA-funded initiative to interview <br>engineers and scientists. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there, earning a promotion to Lab Manager during my senior year, which provided a solid foundation for my professional career.</p>
  
  <p>Following my graduation, I completed an internship at Lenovo, which paved the way for a full-time position as an Associate UX Designer for five years.<br> Unfortunately, my position was affected by a company-wide layoff, marking the end of an incredible chapter in my career. <br>However, I view this transition as an opportunity to leverage my skills and experiences to explore new challenges and contribute to innovative projects while in the meantime learning HTML and CSS.</p>

  <h3>HOBBIES & INTERESTS</h3>
  <p>I love the outdoors, including fishing and camping. I have a passion for animal care, particularly for my two Devon Rex kittens, and I find great joy in reading fantasy literature.<br> Additionally, I am an avid video gamer, playing RPGs, FPS, and Management Colony style games.</p>
